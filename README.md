# ldmx-hgcroc-ana-dump

As the name implies, this is just a dumping ground for my various
analyses related to the HGCROC.

I am keeping this repo here for two reasons:
- example code for others (including future Tom) working with the HGCROC and its data
- pseudo-documentation on how I setup my development/analysis environment

> [!WARNING]
> I will not be documenting this repository.
> Enter at your own risk, no promises are made on if any code you find is currently functional
> (even if it was functional at one time).
